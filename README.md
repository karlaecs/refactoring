Examples from the book [Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code (2nd Edition), by Martin Fowler (Author)](https://martinfowler.com/articles/refactoring-2nd-ed.html)

## Remember

> Before you start refactoring, make sure you have a robust test suite. These tests must be automatically checked

> Refactoring changes programs in small steps so that if you make a mistake, it is easy to locate the bug

> When programming always leaves the codebase healthier than it was when you found it

> The main purpose of refactoring is to make us program faster, adding more value with less effort
